/** An old-fashioned symmetric key, so named because it both encrypts and decrypts.
    A key can be generated at random, stored in the keychain, or derived from a user-entered
    passphrase.
 
    These days, symmetric encryption is used mostly on local data such as files, with
    passphrases; or as a transient "session key" for data sent between users, with the
    session key itself encrypted in the message using public-key encryption. (The
    MYEncoder/MYDecoder classes manage this second usage, whose details are tricky.) */

        passphrase twice, to check for errors, and the nifty passphrase-strength meter will be
        displayed. If NO, there's only one text-field, and an option to display its contents in

    @param saltObj  An arbitrary value whose data will be mixed in with the passphrase before
        hashing, to perturb the resulting bits. The purpose of this is to make it harder for
        an attacker to brute-force the key using a precompiled list of digests of common
        passwords. Changing the salt changes the key, so you need to pass the same value when
        re-deriving the key as you did when first generating it. */
